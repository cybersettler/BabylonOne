    <p class="lead">
      Babylon One will be the first city in space, and the first self sufficient
      space colony in human history. It will open the interplanetary space
      resources to mankind, and will also be the cradle of the most advanced civilization
      in the Solar System. But first we have to make it happen!

    <p>
      Babylon One is an experiment that will take place in virtual space. Conceived as
      multiplayer online game, the goal is to bring together the people who will be the
      first citizens, engineers, scientitst and enterpreneurs of this space metropolis
      to exchange ideas and run a simulation that could be a blue-print for an actual
      space station.

    <p>
      The name of the city was mainly inspired by the mid 90s Scifi TV series
      <em>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_5" target="_blank">Babylon 5</a>
      </em>
      and, in a lesser extent, by the historical
      significance of ancient Babylon, which was the cradle of agricultural civilization.
